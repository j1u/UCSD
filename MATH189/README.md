# MATH189 Assigments and Projects
A collection of my completed assignments from the course MATH189. This course focused on developing our ability to critically analyze and interpret data. Each homework assignment required a report that analyzed and interpreted a dataset. More information about the course can be found here: https://catalog.ucsd.edu/courses/MATH.html
